# Arduino-based-car-monitoring-system

This is an Arduino-based Car monitoring System which implements the following functionalities:

# Object detection:
This detects the distance of the object with respect to the car.

# Temperature sensor:
                   This is to check if the engine is overheating or not.

# Force sensor:
To detect if the air inside the tyres is below the threshold.

# Gas Detection:
 This measures the CO2 emitted by the car and sends a warning if it exceeds the safety limit.
